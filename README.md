# MNIST-Gen

**MNIST-Gen** is a modular framework for generating MNIST-style datasets enhanced with hierarchical semantics, reinforcement learning, and category-theoretic abstractions.  
The pipeline enables customizable dataset creation from raw image collections, automatic clustering and labeling, and export into standardized MNIST-like formats with rich metadata.

The framework is designed to support:
- **Hierarchical Label Structures** â€” Parent/child relationships between classes.
- **Reinforcement Learningâ€“based Filtering** â€” Automated sample selection to improve quality.
- **Category Theoryâ€“Inspired Modular Design** â€” Composable data processing stages.
- **Multi-Domain Adaptability** â€” Works across diverse domains beyond digits.
